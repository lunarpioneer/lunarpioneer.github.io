<p>Week 2 of development has been spent mainly on improving systems, also  beginning original artwork, animations and character design.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also had a few thoughts regarding the name of the project. &#8220;Moon Harvest&#8221; has always been a working title since I came up with the concept. This week I&#8217;ve had a couple of ideas, the best of which is &#8220;Lunar Pioneer&#8221;, which for now, will be the new working title.</p>



<p>An area that hasn&#8217;t started yet is a combat system. Only one area of the game will be combat ready, the mines. Since we&#8217;re aiming for a Gameboy style game and control system there&#8217;s some limitations. Initially my thought was to go for a twin stick shooter like Binding of Isaac, which would fit the style of the game well.</p>



<p>Since the original Gameboy only has 1 direction stick and 2 main buttons, a twin stick shooter just isn&#8217;t possible. So instead, the combat is going to work like Asteroids 1979 &#8211; the player will boost around the screen shooting at enemies which will seek the player. There will be increasing enemy difficulty along with player weapon upgrades and pickups.</p>

<p>As of June 26th 2019 I have decided to complete a childhood goal of mine, to create a playable, and hopefully fun, Video Game myself. I&#8217;m planning on logging this development weekly here with some small updates of what I have completed each week, and how the project is coming as a whole.</p>



<p>Let me introduce the project; it&#8217;s a Harvest Moon / Stardew Valley clone with a working title of &#8220;Moon Harvest&#8221;. Rather than a direct clone, I&#8217;m hoping to introduce some unique mechanics and constraints to the game which I&#8217;m hoping will lead to a more unique experience.</p>



<p>Firstly, the game will be developed with a similar resolution to the original game, including the limited colour palette, this is intended to help me keep the project scope tighter, and the end result smaller, without as many branching paths, things to complete etc. I&#8217;m doing this by myself after all.</p>



<p>My unique take on the farming genre is that you&#8217;re farming for Oxygen. In this way the player stamina system will actually be player Oxygen, and will count down throughout the day along with player actions. Eventually the crop growing system will also have another function, oxygen harvesting. The player will then need to decide if it&#8217;s best to dig up the crops to sell, or to harvest the oxygen they&#8217;re creating. This will take a lot of careful balancing, but I hope to create a system that requires planning and fore-thought of what the player wants to achieve each day, and the best route they can take to fill up their oxygen supplies, and sell off the excess they have.</p>
