<p>As of June 26th 2019 I have decided to complete a childhood goal of mine, to create a playable, and hopefully fun, Video Game myself. I&#8217;m planning on logging this development weekly here with some small updates of what I have completed each week, and how the project is coming as a whole.</p>



<p>Let me introduce the project; it&#8217;s a Harvest Moon / Stardew Valley clone with a working title of &#8220;Moon Harvest&#8221;. Rather than a direct clone, I&#8217;m hoping to introduce some unique mechanics and constraints to the game which I&#8217;m hoping will lead to a more unique experience.</p>



<p>Firstly, the game will be developed with a similar resolution to the original game, including the limited colour palette, this is intended to help me keep the project scope tighter, and the end result smaller, without as many branching paths, things to complete etc. I&#8217;m doing this by myself after all.</p>



<p>My unique take on the farming genre is that you&#8217;re farming for Oxygen. In this way the player stamina system will actually be player Oxygen, and will count down throughout the day along with player actions. Eventually the crop growing system will also have another function, oxygen harvesting. The player will then need to decide if it&#8217;s best to dig up the crops to sell, or to harvest the oxygen they&#8217;re creating. This will take a lot of careful balancing, but I hope to create a system that requires planning and fore-thought of what the player wants to achieve each day, and the best route they can take to fill up their oxygen supplies, and sell off the excess they have.</p>
