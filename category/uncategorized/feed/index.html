<p>Week 4 was the busiest week I&#8217;ll likely have with Lunar Pioneer for a while, as my real life job is going to be busy for a few weeks now. I completed <strong>loads</strong> of tasks this week however, every week I&#8217;m inching Lunar Pioneer toward being a playable and enjoyable game, but right now, it&#8217;s still a state of disconnected systems.</p>



<p>I have started a dedicated <a href="https://twitter.com/lunar_pioneer">Twitter account for Lunar Pioneer</a> also, check it out, follow etc. if you&#8217;re interested in the game and my journey making it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>Adding a full economy to the game</strong></p>



<p>My idea for Lunar Pioneer has always been a dual economy, Gold &amp; Oxygen. The player will have to make a decision of how best to handle their crops, animals etc. Based upon their current needs for either  consumable. As of week 4, the game now has a strong (albeit in need of balance) Gold economy. The player can visit the shop in town, buy seeds, sell crops and grow their farm. It&#8217;s also possible for the player to harvest oxygen from fully grown crops, and add this to mass storage, though nothing happens from there.</p>



<p>I had a number of challenges implementing the shop screen, the chief being that I don&#8217;t want the player to be able to sell key items. The buy screen was quite simple, I already had most of that working by extending the existing Inventory system, but the selling screen was trickier and required creating an array of saleable items within the players inventory, and looping over that, rather than the directly the inventory itself. </p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s the new hammer animation and item dropping animations in game. I had no idea that something which felt so simple in my head could take so much effort to move into the gamespace! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gamedev?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#gamedev</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/indiedev?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#indiedev</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pixelart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pixelart</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gameart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#gameart</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GameMakerStudio2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GameMakerStudio2</a> <a href="https://t.co/ufDEmgSgOz">pic.twitter.com/ufDEmgSgOz</a></p>&mdash; Lunar Pioneer (@lunar_pioneer) <a href="https://twitter.com/lunar_pioneer/status/1153249548925644800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p><strong>New Animations</strong></p>



<p>I&#8217;m no animator, I&#8217;m also not an artist, so getting to work on complex animations (at least, complex to me) for Lunar Pioneer has been a big task. With the prospect of multiple directions * multiple tools * multiple frames for each, my major concern was burning out on so much animation work. Facing this, I spent some time on <a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com">Spriters Resource</a> to get some much needed research done. </p>



<p>What I found was the player sprite sheet for Stardew Valley, which was hugely eye-opening, I should animate the player and the tools separately, that way I&#8217;m only animating the player once, and the same for each tool. Using this technique I now have an animation in place for the Shovel and the Hammer, and, in my opinion at least, they look OK.</p>



<p><strong>Auto Generation</strong></p>



<p>My last big change this week was the beginning implementation of an auto-generation system for the Farm to create the initial farm debris the player will need to clear. The auto-generation itself was very simple, just looping over each area of the &#8220;grid&#8221; on the farm, and placing objects at random.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lunarpioneer.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rocks.png" alt="" class="wp-image-107" srcset="https://lunarpioneer.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rocks.png 641w, https://lunarpioneer.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rocks-300x268.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /><figcaption>Despite being a simple system, it can be manipulated for hilarious results. With a farm like this it would take the player a few days in game to bash a path through to town.</figcaption></figure>



<p>What was difficult about this part of work is that I didn&#8217;t want this auto generation to happen every day, or every time the player visits the farm. The once off behaviour would be simple to implement with a global boolean or similar, but what I wanted was a re-usable system which would track which game day it was, and trigger this, and other events accordingly.</p>



<p>What I found was the Game Maker timeline system, ideally it&#8217;s meant for running complex systems based on game steps, but, if you trigger the timeline for 1 step only (and then stop it running) based on the in game day, what the timeline becomes is almost a calendar; if it&#8217;s day 3 send the player a message etc.</p>



<p>Timelines in Game Maker being a lot more visible than just an array or a similar purely code based system makes this a perfect choice for my event triggers. I have also run some testing on using the same timeline system for generating and controlling levels in the combat area (Mines) of the game, more on this in another devlog soon.</p>

<p>Week 3 has been a very active week of development, new game mechanics, and improved artwork. Just see the size of the changelog in this post! In fact, so much has been completed, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve actually noted it all.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lunarpioneer.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screenshot-2019-07-14-at-15.10.44.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88" srcset="https://lunarpioneer.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screenshot-2019-07-14-at-15.10.44.png 644w, https://lunarpioneer.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screenshot-2019-07-14-at-15.10.44-300x270.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /><figcaption>The first title screen mockup for Lunar Pioneer.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The most important change made to Lunar Pioneer this week is the addition of a combat ready area. Right now I&#8217;m referring to this area as the &#8220;Mines&#8221;. The combat is a mix of Asteroids and Binding of Isaac &#8212; the player moves around similar to Asteroids, but there&#8217;s static walls, and spawning enemies with a (rather simple) AI.</p>



<p>Right now there&#8217;s two types of enemies and only 1 level. A tiny &#8220;slime&#8221; and a small slime that spawns tiny slimes when it&#8217;s killed. Future enemy plans include a boss, an enemy type that can shoot at the player, an enemy type that rushes the player when in close proximity, and lastly an enemy type that would release a shock blast when close enough to the player.</p>



<p><strong>Farm Changes</strong></p>



<p>This week there was very few changes made to the farm area of the game, I have made a few graphical improvements, but the main focus this week was on Inventory &amp; HUD changes, variable systems improvement and adding the combat system to the game.</p>



<p>I did plan a few changes for the farm this week though, the planned changes include a randomised &#8220;dusty&#8221; state for crops each morning, this would require that the crops are cleaned by the vacuum, otherwise they will not grow, or will not generate oxygen.</p>



<p>I also have plans for a dust storm event that will be the games first weather type, during a dust storm day the player cannot remove dust from the crops, and cannot remain outside without losing health.</p>



<p>Lastly, I have plans for an overnight asteroid strike event which will create a new crater on the farm, destroying any crops or objects that it meets.</p>



<p><strong>A New Interior</strong></p>



<p>It is now possible for the player to move locations. This was always going to be required so that the user can visit NPC&#8217;s, as well as having their own space, but it&#8217;s a real pleasure to have the system in place, working and designed.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of changes to come to the interior, including functionality for the storage chest, crafting conveyor, and the addition of a computer for the player to receive mail from the other inhabitants.</p>



<p><strong>Development Week 3: July 7th to July 14th 2019</strong></p>



<ul><li>Updated globalvar to global.variable for future compatibility</li><li>Redesigned inventory screen</li><li>Add player oxygen value &amp; icon to inventory screen</li><li>Add player money value &amp; icon to inventory screen</li><li>Add oxygen storage value &amp; icon to inventory screen</li><li>Add oxygen backpack value &amp; icon to inventory screen</li><li>Redesigned HUD</li><li>Added currently active item to HUD</li><li>Added button press event to switch through currently active items</li><li>Improved day end event sequence</li><li>Seeds need to change amounts when used from inventory</li><li>Add system for harvesting oxygen from fully grown plants daily</li><li>Harvested oxygen goes into the player backpack</li><li>Added deposit to storage system</li><li>Add a meter to the player backpack displaying currently held o2</li><li>Updated inventory system from an array &amp; key array system, to a matrix &#8212; much more flexible</li><li>Added basic inventory item re-ordering</li><li>Redesigned player character ready for tool animations</li><li>Design house interior</li><li>Added room change player positioning functionality</li><li>Diagonal collisions cause the player to get stuck is now fixed!</li><li>Added &#8211; Basic combat area and basic combat system</li><li>Added &#8211; health display to HUD</li><li>Spawn soil on each shovel interaction</li><li>Make crop hole decay after x days, instead of the next day</li></ul>

<p>Week 2 of development has been spent mainly on improving systems, also  beginning original artwork, animations and character design.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lunarpioneer.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ezgif.com-optimize.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-52"/><figcaption>The HUD, dialogue box and day end cycle.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I&#8217;ve also had a few thoughts regarding the name of the project. &#8220;Moon Harvest&#8221; has always been a working title since I came up with the concept. This week I&#8217;ve had a couple of ideas, the best of which is &#8220;Lunar Pioneer&#8221;, which for now, will be the new working title.</p>



<p>An area that hasn&#8217;t started yet is a combat system. Only one area of the game will be combat ready, the mines. Since we&#8217;re aiming for a Gameboy style game and control system there&#8217;s some limitations. Initially my thought was to go for a twin stick shooter like Binding of Isaac, which would fit the style of the game well.</p>



<p>Since the original Gameboy only has 1 direction stick and 2 main buttons, a twin stick shooter just isn&#8217;t possible. So instead, the combat is going to work like Asteroids 1979 &#8211; the player will boost around the screen shooting at enemies which will seek the player. There will be increasing enemy difficulty along with player weapon upgrades and pickups.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lunarpioneer.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hqdefault.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-67" srcset="https://lunarpioneer.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hqdefault.jpg 480w, https://lunarpioneer.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hqdefault-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /><figcaption>Asteroids is the perfect fit for the control system available to Lunar Pioneer.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>Development Week 2 &#8212; <strong>June 30 &#8211; July 7 2019</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Development time this week:</strong> 40 Hours</li><li><strong>Development time total:</strong> 54 Hours</li><li><strong>Animation time:</strong> Not Recorded</li><li><strong>Added:</strong> Objects now drop items when destroyed</li><li><strong>Added:</strong> Working inventory system</li><li><strong>Added:</strong> Inventory selling system</li><li><strong>Improved:</strong> Object index system and functions to add and manage objects</li><li><strong>Improved: </strong>Hole digging system, includes area check and reset on day change</li><li><strong>Improved:</strong> Day time system</li><li><strong>Improved:</strong> Character movement &amp; collision system</li><li><strong>Improved: </strong>Dialogue system, animations, interactions and branching dialogue</li></ul>



<p><strong>Footnotes: </strong>This week I have been working on original artwork for the game using the fantastic <a href="https://www.aseprite.org">Aseprite</a> for art and animations. I&#8217;m also getting ready to begin putting together sounds and background music for the game. I&#8217;m going to use the online retro sound tool <a href="https://www.beepbox.co/">Beepbox</a> for this.</p>

<p>As of June 26th 2019 I have decided to complete a childhood goal of mine, to create a playable, and hopefully fun, Video Game myself. I&#8217;m planning on logging this development weekly here with some small updates of what I have completed each week, and how the project is coming as a whole.</p>



<p>Let me introduce the project; it&#8217;s a Harvest Moon / Stardew Valley clone with a working title of &#8220;Moon Harvest&#8221;. Rather than a direct clone, I&#8217;m hoping to introduce some unique mechanics and constraints to the game which I&#8217;m hoping will lead to a more unique experience.</p>



<p>Firstly, the game will be developed with a similar resolution to the original game, including the limited colour palette, this is intended to help me keep the project scope tighter, and the end result smaller, without as many branching paths, things to complete etc. I&#8217;m doing this by myself after all.</p>



<p>My unique take on the farming genre is that you&#8217;re farming for Oxygen. In this way the player stamina system will actually be player Oxygen, and will count down throughout the day along with player actions. Eventually the crop growing system will also have another function, oxygen harvesting. The player will then need to decide if it&#8217;s best to dig up the crops to sell, or to harvest the oxygen they&#8217;re creating. This will take a lot of careful balancing, but I hope to create a system that requires planning and fore-thought of what the player wants to achieve each day, and the best route they can take to fill up their oxygen supplies, and sell off the excess they have.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lunarpioneer.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/screenshot-1-1024x922.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-31" srcset="https://lunarpioneer.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/screenshot-1-1024x922.jpg 1024w, https://lunarpioneer.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/screenshot-1-300x270.jpg 300w, https://lunarpioneer.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/screenshot-1-768x692.jpg 768w, https://lunarpioneer.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/screenshot-1.jpg 1265w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Right now it&#8217;s not really a game, more of a systems testing area.</figcaption></figure>
