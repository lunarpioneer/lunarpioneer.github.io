<p>Week 3 has been a very active week of development, new game mechanics, and improved artwork. Just see the size of the changelog in this post! In fact, so much has been completed, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve actually noted it all.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://moonharvest.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screenshot-2019-07-14-at-15.10.44.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88" srcset="https://moonharvest.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screenshot-2019-07-14-at-15.10.44.png 644w, https://moonharvest.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screenshot-2019-07-14-at-15.10.44-300x270.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /><figcaption>The first title screen mockup for Lunar Pioneer.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The most important change made to Lunar Pioneer this week is the addition of a combat ready area. Right now I&#8217;m referring to this area as the &#8220;Mines&#8221;. The combat is a mix of Asteroids and Binding of Isaac &#8212; the player moves around similar to Asteroids, but there&#8217;s static walls, and spawning enemies with a (rather simple) AI.</p>



<p>Right now there&#8217;s two types of enemies and only 1 level. A tiny &#8220;slime&#8221; and a small slime that spawns tiny slimes when it&#8217;s killed. Future enemy plans include a boss, an enemy type that can shoot at the player, an enemy type that rushes the player when in close proximity, and lastly an enemy type that would release a shock blast when close enough to the player.</p>



<p><strong>Farm Changes</strong></p>



<p>This week there was very few changes made to the farm area of the game, I have made a few graphical improvements, but the main focus this week was on Inventory &amp; HUD changes, variable systems improvement and adding the combat system to the game.</p>



<p>I did plan a few changes for the farm this week though, the planned changes include a randomised &#8220;dusty&#8221; state for crops each morning, this would require that the crops are cleaned by the vacuum, otherwise they will not grow, or will not generate oxygen.</p>



<p>I also have plans for a dust storm event that will be the games first weather type, during a dust storm day the player cannot remove dust from the crops, and cannot remain outside without losing health.</p>



<p>Lastly, I have plans for an overnight asteroid strike event which will create a new crater on the farm, destroying any crops or objects that it meets.</p>



<p><strong>A New Interior</strong></p>



<p>It is now possible for the player to move locations. This was always going to be required so that the user can visit NPC&#8217;s, as well as having their own space, but it&#8217;s a real pleasure to have the system in place, working and designed.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of changes to come to the interior, including functionality for the storage chest, crafting conveyor, and the addition of a computer for the player to receive mail from the other inhabitants.</p>

<p>Week 2 of development has been spent mainly on improving systems, also  beginning original artwork, animations and character design.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://moonharvest.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ezgif.com-optimize.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-52"/><figcaption>The HUD, dialogue box and day end cycle.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I&#8217;ve also had a few thoughts regarding the name of the project. &#8220;Moon Harvest&#8221; has always been a working title since I came up with the concept. This week I&#8217;ve had a couple of ideas, the best of which is &#8220;Lunar Pioneer&#8221;, which for now, will be the new working title.</p>



<p>An area that hasn&#8217;t started yet is a combat system. Only one area of the game will be combat ready, the mines. Since we&#8217;re aiming for a Gameboy style game and control system there&#8217;s some limitations. Initially my thought was to go for a twin stick shooter like Binding of Isaac, which would fit the style of the game well.</p>



<p>Since the original Gameboy only has 1 direction stick and 2 main buttons, a twin stick shooter just isn&#8217;t possible. So instead, the combat is going to work like Asteroids 1979 &#8211; the player will boost around the screen shooting at enemies which will seek the player. There will be increasing enemy difficulty along with player weapon upgrades and pickups.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://moonharvest.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hqdefault.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-67" srcset="https://moonharvest.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hqdefault.jpg 480w, https://moonharvest.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hqdefault-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /><figcaption>Asteroids is the perfect fit for the control system available to Lunar Pioneer.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>Development Week 2 &#8212; <strong>June 30 &#8211; July 7 2019</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Development time this week:</strong> 40 Hours</li><li><strong>Development time total:</strong> 54 Hours</li><li><strong>Animation time:</strong> Not Recorded</li><li><strong>Added:</strong> Objects now drop items when destroyed</li><li><strong>Added:</strong> Working inventory system</li><li><strong>Added:</strong> Inventory selling system</li><li><strong>Improved:</strong> Object index system and functions to add and manage objects</li><li><strong>Improved: </strong>Hole digging system, includes area check and reset on day change</li><li><strong>Improved:</strong> Day time system</li><li><strong>Improved:</strong> Character movement &amp; collision system</li><li><strong>Improved: </strong>Dialogue system, animations, interactions and branching dialogue</li></ul>



<p><strong>Footnotes: </strong>This week I have been working on original artwork for the game using the fantastic <a href="https://www.aseprite.org">Aseprite</a> for art and animations. I&#8217;m also getting ready to begin putting together sounds and background music for the game. I&#8217;m going to use the online retro sound tool <a href="https://www.beepbox.co/">Beepbox</a> for this.</p>

<p>As of June 26th 2019 I have decided to complete a childhood goal of mine, to create a playable, and hopefully fun, Video Game myself. I&#8217;m planning on logging this development weekly here with some small updates of what I have completed each week, and how the project is coming as a whole.</p>



<p>Let me introduce the project; it&#8217;s a Harvest Moon / Stardew Valley clone with a working title of &#8220;Moon Harvest&#8221;. Rather than a direct clone, I&#8217;m hoping to introduce some unique mechanics and constraints to the game which I&#8217;m hoping will lead to a more unique experience.</p>



<p>Firstly, the game will be developed with a similar resolution to the original game, including the limited colour palette, this is intended to help me keep the project scope tighter, and the end result smaller, without as many branching paths, things to complete etc. I&#8217;m doing this by myself after all.</p>



<p>My unique take on the farming genre is that you&#8217;re farming for Oxygen. In this way the player stamina system will actually be player Oxygen, and will count down throughout the day along with player actions. Eventually the crop growing system will also have another function, oxygen harvesting. The player will then need to decide if it&#8217;s best to dig up the crops to sell, or to harvest the oxygen they&#8217;re creating. This will take a lot of careful balancing, but I hope to create a system that requires planning and fore-thought of what the player wants to achieve each day, and the best route they can take to fill up their oxygen supplies, and sell off the excess they have.</p>
